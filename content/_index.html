            <h2>Designing for Diverse Learners</h2>
            <p>FLOE provides the resources to personalize how we each learn and to address barriers to learning. Learners learn differently, and todayâ€™s society needs diverse, self-aware, life-long learners.<br /> FLOE supports learners, educators and curriculum producers in achieving one-size-fits-one learning design for the full diversity of learners, leveraging the variants made possible by Open Education Resources (OER).

            Floe is led by the Inclusive Design Research Centre and applies Inclusive Design to open learning.Being able to transform, augment, and select alternative educational resources to fit individual needs is essential for an inclusive learning experience</p>

            <h2>Looking for help making rich content more inclusive?</h2>
            <p>The HTML5 Video Player offers full keyboard access, captions, transcripts, descriptions and responds to personal user preferences. Learners can request missing captions, descriptions and transcripts, or create them . <br />Students with disabilities often depend on digital technology and adapted instruction to participate in class, communicate with family, and share with their friends. Our goal is to <strong>empower all learners to be creators</strong> of their digital worlds, to <strong>express themselves using code and art</strong>, and to apply these skills to other areas of <strong>learning and daily life</strong>. Not just learning to code, but coding to learn and create.</p>

            <h2>Need guidance in designing accessible resources?</h2>
            <p>The Inclusive Learning Design Handbook is an expanding source of guidance, tools and tips for producing inclusively designed learning resources, including guidelines for creating inclusive EPUB 3 resources, accessible standardized tests, and inclusive web games and simulations.

             Floe has created The Inclusive Design Guide - an engaging and evolving resource for learning about and applying Inclusive Design principles, practices, and tools to the design process.
                
              The Metadata Editor makes it simple to provide useful labels regarding the learner preferences the resource can meet, and supports authors in adding accessibility features.

            <h2>Not sure how you learn best?</h2>
            <p>The First Discovery Tool helps newcomers learn about what kinds of personalizations are possible, and what might work for them.

                <br />  The Preference Exploration Tool offers a set of starter preferences to try - from reading content aloud so it's easier to follow along, to enhancing keyboard interactions so it's easier to use. <br />The My Lifelong Learning Lab helps learners keep track of their progress, and personalize their learning goals and learning experience through self-reflection.
                The Preference Management Tools support portable preferences - you can apply preferences across devices, resources and learning applications using the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure. The GPII security architecture gives you complete control over who has access to your preferences. </p>

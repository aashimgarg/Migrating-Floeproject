# NROC Member Meeting 2019


 In March, the IDRC was invited to speak at the 11th annual NROC Member Meeting attended by educational practictioners, technologists, and researchers from all over the United States. This year's theme was called "A Thriving Hive" - focusing on collaboration and mutual success through our unique contributions.

 The IDRC presented "Accessibility Through Inclusive Design Thinking" (PDF of slides) which summarized the 3 principles of inclusive design, how these principles can be applied practically, and how the broader goal of inclusion and access can be accomplished through this.

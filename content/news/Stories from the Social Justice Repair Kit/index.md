# Stories from the Social Justice Repair Kit


On October 17th, the Social Justice Repair Kit project met to reflect on the past three years of work. Participants created stories to capture their experiences on the project. Highlights included training youth to lead environmental protection work and doing audio-visual workshops with youth at the margins, enabling them to not only tell their stories but also to capture and present them in ways they want to.

# CISL Site and Demo Launched

The Center on Inclusive Software for Learning (CISL) is creating a suite of innovative tools to create, discover and use accessible, adaptable digital learning resources. 

 Led by CAST and funded by the U.S Department of Education's Office of Special Education Programs, the CISL suite will make digital educational materials accessible, flexible, and engaging for all students. 

  The Floe project is working as a partner on the CISL project to integrate Floe tools such as Learner Options into the CISL Reader and other parts of the software suite, and to apply its principles of inclusive design for learning.
